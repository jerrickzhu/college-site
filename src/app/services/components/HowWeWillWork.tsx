        How We'll Work Together

        During my time in an Ivy League admissions office, the biggest question
        I always have when reading was, "Did this student really present
        themselves well in this application?" The answer was often no,
        especially after denying so many students. One of the biggest problems
        is that students often cannot reveal who they are and their own
        intellectual heart very well in applications. So, one of the biggest
        things I focus on with students is introspection. Who are you? Why do
        you love learning? What do you love learning about? We'll use those
        fundamental questions to start bridging the gap between you and the
        colleges you want to go to. But before that, we'll get you and your
        family familiar with the landscape of college admissions. After that, we
        have three stage process to getting you to the end: Introspection and
        Mentorship, Essay Revisions, and Application Review.
